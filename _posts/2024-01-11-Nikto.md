## **Scanning Web Applications With Nikto**

This lab environment was set up simply to test the took `nikto`. As such there are no questions or real requirements for what to do beyond running a simple nikto scan.

This can be accomplished by using the `ifconfig` command and identifying the subnet that the web application is on.

Then I just increment my machines IP address by 1 and I have the location of the web application. Using the following command, with the `h` switch to indicate the target host, I can scan it with Nikto: 

`nikto -h http://192.129.243.2` 

Or to output the scan results into a file: 

`nikto -h http://192.129.243.2 -o <filename.type> -Format <fileformat>`

The scan will return many pages of results but eventually it lets me know that it's complete.
