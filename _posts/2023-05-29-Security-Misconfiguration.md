## **OWASP Top 10 WebGoat - Security Misconfigurations**

<ins>**Introduction**</ins>

*WebGoat* is a deliberately insecure web application maintained by *OWASP* designed to teach web application security lessons. More information including how to download and run WebGoat can be found here on the projects [GitHub](https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat).
This is post six of a series where I will be doing WebGoats challenges to further my understanding of the OWASP Top 10 and web application security as a whole. I have started from the number 10 and am working my way backwards to number 1.
