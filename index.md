## Who am I?

I am Crumbles, at least online anyway. In real life most people just call me Matt. I am over a year into my Cybersecurity journey, and I've made significant progress along the way. As a CompTIA Security+ certified professional, I bring a solid foundation of knowledge and skills to the table. After my own time as a student at Fullstack Academy I worked for two cohorts as a Cybersecurity Mentor in their full time program. Alongside allowing me to hone my own skills by utilizing them from an instructors perspective it was a rewarding experience to educate and guide those who chose to follow a similar path. 

Throughout this journey I discovered my true passion lies in Offensive Security, as such I am currently studying for the eJPT certification to further enhance my expertise in the field. Currently this blog's main purpose is to serve as a personal project portfolio so if you decide to take the time to check out some of my posts feel free to leave a comment. Whether I helped you learn something new or you think this is just the same rehashed content everyone else puts out I'd love to hear it. After all everyone has a blog, bud.
