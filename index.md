## Who am I?

I am Crumbles, at least online anyway. In real life most people just call me Matt. I'm a highly motivated Cybersecurity professional with a passion for continuous learning and staying ahead in this dynamic field. My journey in cybersecurity has been rewarding, and I'm thrilled to share my experiences that I often document right here on my personal project portfolio, 'Everyone Has a Blog, Bud".

Having successfully obtained the eJPT certification, I'm now working towards PortSwigger's Burp Suite Certified Practitioner to expand on my knowledge of web application security and exploitation. I am eager to take on exciting projects, collaborate with like-minded professionals, and contribute to securing the digital world. So if you decide to take the time to check out some of my posts feel free to leave a comment. Whether I helped you learn something new or you think this is just the same rehashed content everyone else puts out Iâ€™d love to hear it. After all everyone has a blog, bud.
